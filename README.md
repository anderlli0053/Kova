# Kova

A fast, keyboard-driven presentation editor for people who'd rather write than click.

Kova turns plain Markdown into polished slides — with live preview, multiple layouts, theming, and PPTX export — all in a native desktop app.

## Features

- **Markdown-first** — write slides in plain text, separated by `---`
- **Auto layout** — title, section, split, two-column, grid, quote, full-bleed, and more, detected automatically from content
- **Live preview** — editor and preview stay in sync as you type
- **Syntax highlighting** — fenced code blocks rendered with highlight.js
- **Mermaid diagrams** — pie, bar, line charts and flowcharts inline
- **Themes** — built-in themes plus custom YAML themes from `~/.kova/themes/`
- **Focus mode** — dims non-active slides, collapses side panels
- **Fullscreen presentation** — speaker notes, slide counter, keyboard and click navigation *(in development — multi-monitor mode is currently unstable)*
- **PPTX export** — export to PowerPoint (16:9 and 4:3)
- **YouTube & poll embeds** — `!youtube[label](url)` opens in browser; `!poll[label](url)` renders a QR code
- **File watcher** — reloads automatically when the file is edited externally
- **Keybindings** — configurable via `~/.kova/keybindings.yaml`
