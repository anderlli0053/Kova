## Features

- **Markdown-first** — write slides in plain text, separated by `---`
- **Auto layout** — title, section, split, two-column, grid, quote, full-bleed, and more
- **Live preview** — editor and preview stay in sync as you type
- **Syntax highlighting** — fenced code blocks rendered with highlight.js
- **Math & LaTeX** — inline and block math via KaTeX (`$...$` and `$$...$$`)
- **Mermaid diagrams** — pie, bar, line charts and flowcharts inline
- **Themes** — 11 built-in themes, community themes, and custom YAML
- **Focus mode** — dims non-active slides, collapses side panels
- **Fullscreen presentation** — speaker notes, slide counter, keyboard and click navigation
- **PPTX export** — export to PowerPoint (16:9 and 4:3)
- **Academic references** — cite sources with `!ref[Author, Year. Title]`; renders as small bottom-right text on the slide and exports to PPTX
- **YouTube & poll embeds** — `!youtube[label](url)` and `!poll[label](url)`
- **Local video** — `!video[label](path.mp4)` plays an inline file (relative to the document or absolute)
- **Insert media** — drag-drop, paste, or right-click → Insert → Image or Video; files are copied into `assets/` automatically
- **File watcher** — reloads automatically when the file is edited externally
- **Keybindings** — configurable via `~/.config/kova/keybindings.yaml`

## Linux package managers

> **AppImage note** — Bundled graphics libs are stripped for compatibility with Arch/Fedora/etc., and the AppImage is signed so in-app auto-update works. See [issue #3](https://github.com/KovaMD/Kova/issues/3) for background.

**Debian / Ubuntu**

```bash
sudo curl -fsSL https://deb.kova.md/key.gpg \
  | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kova.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kova.gpg] https://deb.kova.md stable main" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kova.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install kova
```

Debian 13+ — use the [DEB822 source format](https://wiki.kova.md/install/linux/).

**Fedora / RHEL / openSUSE**

```bash
sudo rpm --import https://rpm.kova.md/key.gpg
sudo curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/kova.repo \
  https://rpm.kova.md/kova.repo
sudo dnf install kova   # openSUSE: zypper install kova
```

## Building from source

**Prerequisites:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+, [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (stable), and [Tauri prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your platform.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KovaMD/Kova.git
cd Kova
npm install
npm run tauri dev      # development — hot-reload
npm run tauri build    # release binary
```

See the [Contributing guide](https://wiki.kova.md/contributing/) for more details.

## Keybindings

To customise, edit your keybindings file (created automatically on first launch), or open it from **Settings → Keyboard Shortcuts → Open file**.

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| **macOS** | `~/Library/Application Support/kova/keybindings.yaml` |
| **Linux** | `~/.config/kova/keybindings.yaml` |
| **Windows** | `%APPDATA%\kova\keybindings.yaml` |

Custom themes follow the same base path, under a `themes/` subfolder. Full reference on the [Keyboard Shortcuts](https://wiki.kova.md/keyboard-shortcuts/) wiki page.

## Themes

**Theme library** — open the Inspector, expand **Theme**, and click **More Themes…** to browse and install community themes from the [KovaMD/Themes](https://github.com/KovaMD/Themes) repository. Each download is verified against a SHA-256 checksum. Installed themes appear in the picker immediately.

**Custom themes** — place YAML theme files in the `themes/` subfolder of your config directory (see Keybindings above for platform paths). They appear in the Inspector alongside built-in themes. See the [Themes](https://wiki.kova.md/themes/) wiki page for the full YAML format.
